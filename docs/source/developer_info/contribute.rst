Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

scikit-perm has documentation at scikit-perm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ but feedback/corrections
on areas that are unclear or incorrect would be really helpful. Also any example notebooks can be added in the
tutorial notebooks folder.

Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/jameschapman19/cca_zoo/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)
